## Feedback to our Coding Challenge

We care very much about our recruitment process in general and about the case study in particular. This is the reason why we kindly ask you to provide us with some feedback after you have solved the case study. We automated ü§ñ the process of sending out the case-study, but we can assure you that a human üßîüë© Ô∏èwill read your answers and of course review your code.

### ‚è±Ô∏è How many hours did you spend on completing the task?

YOUR ANSWER HERE
Approximately 10 hours.

### ü§∑ Are you happy with your solution/submission?

YOUR ANSWER HERE
More or less. It could be better once I have more time for development and research for the best problem solution.

### üõ† What would you improve if you had more time to work on the task?

YOUR ANSWER HERE
1) Improve approach to find optimal package contents (make it faster and less memory consumptive)
2) Apply more complex custom error messages structure
3) Add metrics for measuring solution execution
4) Improve validation mechanism
5) Add logs
6) Come to 100% test coverage

### üò§ What are the difficulties/problems you faced while doing the task?

YOUR ANSWER HERE
The main difficulty was to find an optimal algorithm for the given problem.

### üí¨ Any free form feedback you would like to share with us?

## Problem Description

Imagine you're given a package in which you are to place a number of given items. The items each have a given weight (in kg) and a given price (in ‚Ç¨). There's a total of `n` items. Each item has a unique ID, ranging from `1` to `n`.

In general, the package will not be able to hold all the given items. The reason is that there's a maximum weight the package can hold. It can only hold the items you place in the package if their total weight doesn't exceed this maximum weight.

It is now your job to pick a subset of the given items so that their total price is maximized and their combined weight doesn't exceed the maximum weight the package can hold.

Write a RESTful service that solves this problem. The service should have one endpoint which accepts a specification of the problem to solve, in particular

- the maximum weight the package can hold.
- a list of the items, each with their own ID, weight and price.

The service should verify that the following conditions are met:

- The maximum number of items is 15, i.e. `n <= 15`.
- The maximum weight of an item is 100 kg.
- The maximum price of an item is 100 ‚Ç¨.
- The maximum weight the package can hold is 100 kg.

In case any one of these constraints is violated, an error message indicating the problem should be returned.

Otherwise, the service should return the IDs of those items that are to be placed in the package in order to maximize their total price, as described above.

If there's more than one combination of items having the same maximum price, then the IDs of the combination having the lowest total weight among them should be returned.

Don't forget to document the API.

## Examples

Here are a few examples that might help you better understand the problem.

### Example 1

Given a list of these 9 items

| Item ID | Weight   | Price |
|:-------:|----------|-------|
| 1       | 85.31 kg | 29 ‚Ç¨  |
| 2       | 14.55 kg | 74 ‚Ç¨  |
| 3       |  3.98 kg | 16 ‚Ç¨  |
| 4       | 26.24 kg | 55 ‚Ç¨  |
| 5       | 63.69 kg | 52 ‚Ç¨  |
| 6       | 76.25 kg | 75 ‚Ç¨  |
| 7       | 60.02 kg | 74 ‚Ç¨  |
| 8       | 93.18 kg | 35 ‚Ç¨  |
| 9       | 89.95 kg | 78 ‚Ç¨  |

and a maximum package weight of `75 kg`, then items `2` and `7` can be placed in the package for a combined weight of `74.57 kg` and a total price of `148 ‚Ç¨`. This is the optimal solution given the above constraints. The service should thus return the IDs `2` and `7`.


### Example 2

Given a list of these six items

| Item ID | Weight   | Price |
|:-------:|----------|-------|
| 1       | 53.38 kg | 45 ‚Ç¨  |
| 2       | 88.62 kg | 98 ‚Ç¨  |
| 3       | 78.48 kg |  3 ‚Ç¨  |
| 4       | 72.30 kg | 76 ‚Ç¨  |
| 5       | 30.18 kg |  9 ‚Ç¨  |
| 6       | 46.34 kg | 48 ‚Ç¨  |

and a maximum package weight of `80 kg`, the service should return the ID `4`, which is the optimal solution.

### Example 3

Given a list with this single item

| Item ID | Weight   | Price |
|:-------:|----------|-------|
| 1       | 15.3 kg  | 34‚Ç¨   |

and a maximum package weight of `8 kg` the service should return an error, indicating that no items can be placed in the package under the given constraints.


### Example 4

Given a list of the following 9 items

| Item ID | Weight   | Price |
|:-------:|----------|-------|
| 1       | 90.72 kg | 13 ‚Ç¨  |
| 2       | 33.80 kg | 40 ‚Ç¨  |
| 3       | 43.15 kg | 10 ‚Ç¨  |
| 4       | 37.97 kg | 16 ‚Ç¨  |
| 5       | 46.81 kg | 36 ‚Ç¨  |
| 6       | 48.77 kg | 79 ‚Ç¨  |
| 7       | 81.80 kg | 45 ‚Ç¨  |
| 8       | 19.36 kg | 79 ‚Ç¨  |
| 9       | 6.76 kg  | 64 ‚Ç¨  |

and a maximum package weight of `56 kg` the service should return item IDs `8` and `9`, the optimal combination of items.

## Final Remarks

Feel free to use the attached [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) skeleton project or implement the solution from scratch.

Apply the best software design and development practices. Document your solution appropriately.

## How to submit your solution
